            <h2>Join Me on My Journey to Land a Remote Job</h2>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>I am striving to secure a global remote job for two primary reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Moving to India to stay close to my parents.</li>
                <li>Having the freedom to move around.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The process of landing a global remote job differs significantly from securing a typical FAANG role.
                While there are abundant resources for FAANG job preparation, the key aspects typically include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proficiency in algorithms, i.e., solving two medium-level Leetcode questions within an hour.</li>
                <li>For senior roles, a strong understanding of System Design concepts is essential.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In contrast, for global remote jobs, Iâ€™ve noticed that having a robust portfolio to showcase your work is
                crucial. This is especially true for smaller companies offering remote opportunities, as they cannot
                afford the risk of a bad hire. Demonstrating your capabilities through past work is vital.</p>

            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>How can you demonstrate your software engineering skills when working at a FAANG company, where much of
                your work is confidential and proprietary? Showcasing your abilities becomes a challenge.</p>

            <h4>Strategy</h4>
            <p>To address this, I've decided to dedicate extra time outside work to develop skills and build a public
                portfolio. This strategy has several advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working on side projects I've always dreamt of.</li>
                <li>Enhancing my full-stack application development skills.</li>
                <li>Exploring new technologies and trends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This website is part of that</p>
